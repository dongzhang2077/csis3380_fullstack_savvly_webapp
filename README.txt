INSTALLATION & SETUP
------------------
1. Install Server Dependencies:
   cd CSIS3380-Project/server
   npm install

2. Install Client Dependencies:
   cd CSIS3380-Project/client
   npm install

3. Environment Configuration:
   Server .env file is already configured with:
   - MongoDB Atlas connection string
   - JWT secret key
   - Port 5000

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
--------------------
IMPORTANT: You need TWO separate terminal windows/tabs

Terminal 1 - Start Backend Server:
   cd CSIS3380-Project/server
   npm run dev
   
   Expected Output:
   ✅ Server listening on http://localhost:5000
   ✅ MongoDB connected

Terminal 2 - Start React Client:
   cd CSIS3380-Project/client
   npm start
   
   Expected Output:
   Compiled successfully!
   Opens browser at http://localhost:3000

TESTING THE APPLICATION
---------------------
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

2. User Authentication Flow:
   - Click "Sign Up" → Register a new account
   - Or use test account: user_9684@savvly.com / password123
   - After login, see your username in top-right corner
   - Click "Logout" to end session

3. Navigate through all pages using the navbar:
   - Dashboard (/)
   - Budgets (/budgets)
   - Transactions (/transactions)
   - Exchange Rates (/exchange-rates)

4. Test CRUD Operations:
   Budget Operations:
   - Click "Budgets" → View your budgets (empty for new users)
   - Click "+ Create Budget" → Add new budget (Bootstrap form with validation)
   - Click "Edit" on any budget → Update budget details
   - Click "Delete" on any budget → Remove budget

   Transaction Operations:
   - Click "Transactions" → View your transaction history
   - Fill form and click "Add Transaction" → Create new transaction
   - Toggle "Income/Expense" switch
   - Click "Delete" to remove transaction (dashboard auto-updates)
   - Change "Show" dropdown to view 10/25/50/100 transactions

   External API:
   - Click "Exchange Rates" → View live currency rates
   - Change base currency (e.g., CAD, EUR)
   - Click "Refresh" to fetch latest rates
   - View spotlight currencies and full rate table

5. Test User Data Isolation:
   - Register multiple accounts
   - Create budgets/transactions in each account
   - Verify each user only sees their own data
   - Run test script: ./test-user-flow.ps1

API ENDPOINTS (Backend Routes)
----------------------------
Authentication:
POST /api/auth/register  - Register new user (returns JWT token)
POST /api/auth/login     - Login user (returns JWT token)

Budgets (Protected - Requires Authentication):
GET    /api/budgets      - Get user's budgets (supports ?month=11&year=2025)
GET    /api/budgets/:id  - Get single budget (user-owned only)
POST   /api/budgets      - Create new budget (auto-assigns userId)
PUT    /api/budgets/:id  - Update budget (user-owned only)
DELETE /api/budgets/:id  - Delete budget (user-owned only)

Transactions (Protected - Requires Authentication):
GET    /api/transactions - Get user's transactions (?limit=50)
POST   /api/transactions - Create transaction (auto-assigns userId)
DELETE /api/transactions/:id - Delete transaction (user-owned only)

Authentication Method:
- JWT Bearer tokens sent in Authorization header
- Axios interceptors automatically attach tokens
- Tokens stored in localStorage with 7-day expiry

DESIGN NOTES
----------
- Color Palette: Savvly uses calm blue/green tones for financial wellness
- Responsive Design: Bootstrap 5 grid system for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- User-Friendly: Soft language, no harsh warnings
- Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- Modern UI: Card-based layouts, shadow effects, hover states
- Form Validation: Real-time validation with React Hook Form + Zod
- Loading States: Spinners for async operations
- Empty States: Friendly messages with icons when no data exists

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
---------------
- MongoDB deprecation warnings (useNewUrlParser, useUnifiedTopology) are harmless
- Exchange rate API has rate limits on free tier
- Old data in database (before user isolation) won't have userId field
- Password reset functionality not yet implemented

TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------
Port 3000 already in use:
  - Kill existing process: Stop-Process -Id <PID>
  - Or run on different port when prompted

Server won't connect to MongoDB:
  - Check internet connection
  - Verify .env file exists in server folder
  - Confirm MONGODB_URI is valid

API requests failing:
  - Ensure server is running on port 5000
  - Check console for CORS errors
  - Verify API_BASE_URL in client matches server

BUILD FOR PRODUCTION
------------------
Client Build:
  cd CSIS3380-Project/client
  npm run build
  
  Creates optimized production build in client/build/

Server Production:
  cd CSIS3380-Project/server
  npm start
  
  Runs server without nodemon hot-reload
